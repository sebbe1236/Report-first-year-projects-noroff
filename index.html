            </li>
            <li>
              rewrote the function in featured.js by removing the productfetch() inside the async function and replacing
              it with return after then i did a .then statement instead at the bottom to make sure everything runs in
              order.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Why i changed it:</h3>
          <p>
            Did some h1s for user flow on the page which changing the font for the h1 to make it stick out and site
            hierachy. The reason for adding the loader was because the API loads a bit slow so decided to put a loader
            there. It gave a smoother transition instead of the content just poping up out of nowhere after 3 seconds. I
            ended up redoing the About page with CSS grid. The reason for that was making the page fill out better.
            Before it was just two pictures with text under.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now its more complete with two pictures that has articles. Changing buttons and some colors was for WCAG
            purposes and responsiveness. Font face removed since i already had it in the head section in the html by
            delecting from the CSS file.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tried doing a lot of minor changes that didn`t change it all for the users because of what we read about
            incremental changes in the interaction design course. I also added a new property in the Woocommerce with
            tag so i could use that one for the frontpage and a more detailed title on the product specific page for
            more information. Added lorum ipsum on the product description in WP woocom since before it was only 1 line
            and that looked kind of stupid. Did change the pixel site on frontpage pictures to get rid of the big white
            gap and fill out the page more. Also took what i learned with .then statements and rewrote some of the
            featured JS since it returned a typeerror message in the console. Turned out it wasn`t running in the
            correct order.

            <li>Image logo size on mobile</li>
            <li>h1 Fonts changed to Lato sans serif after tutor feedback because it was to neutral.</li>
            <li>Changed header and footer color after tutor feedback to fit target audience</li>
            <li>Added a own article under contact us in the get involved page for readability/aestethics.</li>

        <div>
          <h3>How i changed it:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I changed the color value on the header property in CSS.</li>
            <li>
              Changed the logo on mobile to smaller by removing the height property and setting widtth in % instead of
              pixels.
            </li>
            <li>
              Setting a CSS grid on the get involved page and moving the picture and articles inside their own columns
              by having the content inside their own divs.
            </li>
            <li>Changed the h1 font by setting font-family Lato on that property.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Why i changed it:</h3>
          <p>
            The mobile logo was kind of big on the small screens so thats why i updated it after tutor feedback. Setting
            width % was something that applied to all the images but didn`t think about the logo as a image at the time
            i made the assignment. Changing the width in % worked better then setting it in pixels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ended up changing the h1s after tutor feedback to have tthem stick out a bit more from the other H tags. I
            don`t know if the h1s will be better then it was before but atleast it sticks out now. So will look forward
            to feedback on that.

        <div>
          <h3>Why i changed it:</h3>
          <p>
            Changed the transition because the from scale too all 1s because i got the picture to align with min-width.
            Before it just went out of the screen with position fixed so i had a animate transition that scaled the
            picture. That got removed and replaced with what i explained above. The reason i removed the background
            color on the error message was because it kind of looked like a overkill and a bit too much. Changed too
            font-weight bold instead. For the modal height i spent some time in the console too see what would work. 800
            turned out pretty good. For the image slider i decided to do float propety to have the far left and right. I
            tried too position them with aboslute to have them be in middle of picture which worked for desktop but not
            mobile. Thats why i ended up with float instead.
